Sharvari is an AI Engineer with a strong focus on **building end-to-end, production-grade AI systems**, spanning computer vision, large language models, and agent-based workflows. Her work prioritises reliability, structure, and real-world usability over standalone demos or theoretical prototypes.

She has professional experience developing **accessibility-focused computer vision systems**, including sign-language avatar pipelines for the Deaf community. This work involved taking models from research exploration through to cloud-deployed services, covering data preprocessing, model fine-tuning, evaluation, inference optimisation, and deployment using modern infrastructure.

Alongside vision systems, Sharvari has built multiple **LLM-powered applications**, including agent-based planners, multi-agent decision systems, retrieval-augmented pipelines, and developer tooling. She treats LLMs as system components integrated with data, APIs, and tools, with an emphasis on grounding, structured outputs, and failure-aware design.

Her academic background includes an MSc in Artificial Intelligence with hands-on coursework in **diffusion-based image generation, evaluation using FID, and natural language processing**, as well as a research-focused dissertation in semantic scene understanding.

Overall, Sharvari’s profile reflects a **systems-oriented AI Engineer** who is comfortable operating across research and production boundaries, delivering AI solutions that work under real constraints and create meaningful impact.

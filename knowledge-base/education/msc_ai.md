## Academic Focus

The MSc program provided a strong foundation across both **theoretical and applied artificial intelligence**, with an emphasis on experimentation, evaluation, and system-level thinking.

Key focus areas included:
- Computer Vision
- Machine Learning
- Deep Learning
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Multimodal AI Systems

## Key Coursework

### Applied Machine Learning

- Trained **Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs)** for image generation
- Worked with the CIFAR-10 dataset, focusing on class-conditional image generation
- Conducted extensive **hyperparameter experimentation** (batch size, learning rate)
- Evaluated generative quality using **Fréchet Inception Distance (FID)**
- Analysed training stability, convergence behaviour, and performance trade-offs
- Gained hands-on experience with UNet-based architectures and diffusion pipelines

This coursework emphasised **practical model training, evaluation, and iterative improvement** rather than purely theoretical analysis. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)

- Worked on **sequence classification and named entity recognition (NER)** tasks
- Performed extensive data analysis and visualisation for linguistic datasets
- Implemented and compared multiple approaches, including:
  - Traditional ML models (SVM)
  - Neural models (Feed Forward Neural Networks)
  - Embedding techniques (GloVe, Word2Vec)
  - Transformer-based tokenisation (BERT)
- Conducted **hyperparameter optimisation**, early stopping, and loss-function analysis
- Evaluated models using accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrices, and class imbalance handling

This coursework strengthened understanding of **NLP pipelines, evaluation strategies, and practical trade-offs in model selection**. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## Dissertation

**Title:** Semantically-Aware Generation of Vector Scene Sketches

The dissertation focused on improving scene-level sketch generation by enhancing semantic understanding in vector-based representations. The work involved modifying existing research architectures, integrating specialised encoders, and evaluating results using sketch-based image retrieval techniques.

## Outcome

The MSc experience reinforced a strong foundation in:
- Training and evaluating deep learning models
- Applying rigorous evaluation metrics (e.g. FID, F1-score)
- Balancing research exploration with implementation constraints
- Translating academic concepts into applied AI systems

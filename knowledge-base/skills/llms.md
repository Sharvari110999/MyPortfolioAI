# Skill: Large Language Models (LLMs)

Level: Strong (Applied Systems)

---

## Evidence

- Designed and implemented LLM-powered systems for real-world tasks
- Built multi-agent LLM workflows for decision-making and planning
- Developed a personal **AI Code Documentation Generator** that uses LLMs for code understanding and structured documentation  
- Applied Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) principles in portfolio system design

Key Projects:
- AI Code Documentation Generator
- AI Travel Planning Agent
- Cryptocurrency Trend Predictor System
- RAG-based AI portfolio assistant

---

## Core Capabilities

- Prompt design for structured reasoning and controlled outputs
- Using LLMs for **code understanding and developer tooling**
- Tool calling and API orchestration
- Multi-step reasoning and task decomposition
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Integrating LLMs as components within larger systems

---

## Tooling & Frameworks

- LangChain
- LangGraph
- Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- Vector databases (FAISS, Chroma)
- OpenAI-compatible LLM APIs
- Python

---

## Engineering Focus

LLMs are treated as **system components**, not standalone chatbots.  
Emphasis is placed on:
- Grounded and evidence-based responses
- Structured inputs and outputs
- Separation of concerns (retrieval, reasoning, execution)
- Awareness of LLM limitations when reasoning over large or complex codebases

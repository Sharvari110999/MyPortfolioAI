# Anti-Misinformation RL Swarm

Context: Hackathon Project  
Sponsor: Gensyn  
Outcome: Won Gensyn Bounty · Top 12 overall in hackathon

---

## Overview

This project explored the use of **multi-agent reinforcement learning** concepts to detect and counter the spread of misinformation. The system was designed as a swarm of agents, each contributing independent signals to help identify potentially misleading or harmful content.

The focus of the project was on **conceptual system design and rapid experimentation**, rather than building a fully production-ready solution.

---

## High-Level Idea

- Multiple agents operate in parallel
- Each agent analyses information from different perspectives or data sources
- Agents collectively contribute to identifying misinformation patterns
- A swarm-based approach is used to improve robustness compared to single-model decisions

---

## Contribution

- Participated in the design and implementation of the swarm-based approach
- Contributed to experimentation with agent interactions and decision logic
- Worked under tight hackathon constraints to deliver a functional prototype

---

## Tools & Concepts

- Python
- Reinforcement learning concepts
- Multi-agent systems
- Swarm-based reasoning
- Rapid prototyping

---

## Results & Recognition

- **Won the Gensyn sponsor bounty**
- **Placed in the Top 12 overall** among all hackathon teams
- Recognised for innovative use of multi-agent and RL-inspired ideas

---

## What This Demonstrates

- Exposure to **reinforcement learning and multi-agent paradigms**
- Ability to explore complex AI ideas under time pressure
- Comfort working with experimental system designs
- Effective collaboration in competitive hackathon environments

---

## Notes

This project was intentionally exploratory and focused on validating ideas quickly rather than exhaustive optimisation or evaluation.

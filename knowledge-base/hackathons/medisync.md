# MediSync

Context: Hackathon Project  
Sponsor: Tonk  
Outcome: Won Tonk Bounty

---

## Overview

MediSync was a hackathon project focused on exploring how AI-driven systems can help **coordinate and streamline healthcare-related workflows**. The system aimed to integrate information from multiple sources and present it in a more structured and accessible way.

The project prioritised **rapid prototyping and sponsor alignment**, rather than building a fully production-ready healthcare system.

## High-Level Idea

- Centralise healthcare-related information
- Reduce manual coordination through AI-assisted workflows
- Improve accessibility and clarity of medical data

---

## Contribution

- Contributed to system design discussions and rapid prototyping
- Assisted with integrating components under tight hackathon constraints
- Worked collaboratively to adapt the solution to sponsor requirements

---

## Tools & Concepts

- Python
- Agent-based systems (conceptual)
- API integration
- Rapid prototyping

---

## Results & Recognition

- **Won the Tonk sponsor bounty**
- Recognised for practical applicability within a constrained timeframe

---

## What This Demonstrates

- Exposure to AI applications in the healthcare domain
- Ability to work on domain-specific problems under time pressure
- Adaptability to sponsor-driven requirements
- Effective collaboration in hackathon environments

---

## Notes

This project was exploratory and focused on validating ideas quickly rather than implementing a complete healthcare solution.

# AI Code Documentation Generator

Category: Applied LLM Systems / Developer Tooling  
Context: Personal Project  
Responsibility: End-to-end design and implementation

## Problem Statement

Writing and maintaining high-quality documentation for codebases is time-consuming and often neglected, especially in fast-paced development environments.  
The goal of this project was to build an **LLM-powered system that automatically generates meaningful documentation for code**, improving developer productivity and code readability.

---

## Approach

The system analyses source code files and uses a **large language model** to generate structured documentation based on the code’s logic, functions, and usage patterns.

Rather than producing generic summaries, the focus was on:
- Capturing intent
- Explaining function-level behaviour
- Generating developer-friendly explanations

The project was designed as a **developer-facing AI tool**, not a research prototype.

## System Overview

High-level workflow:
1. Input source code is ingested
2. Code is preprocessed and structured
3. Relevant context is passed to the LLM
4. The model generates documentation aligned with code structure
5. Output is formatted for developer use

## Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Large Language Models (API-based)
- Prompt engineering for code understanding
- File parsing and preprocessing logic

---

## Evidence of Skill

- Designed prompts tailored for code comprehension tasks
- Built an LLM-based system focused on developer workflows
- Handled structured inputs and controlled output formats
- Demonstrated understanding of LLM limitations when reasoning over code
- Built a complete system independently from idea to implementation

---

## Why This Project Matters

This project demonstrates:
- Practical use of LLMs beyond chat interfaces
- Understanding of LLM strengths and weaknesses in code-related tasks
- Ability to build developer tools powered by AI
- Product-oriented thinking applied to LLM systems
